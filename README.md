Seeder kit for creating microfrontends with @nrwl/nx workspaces. CI scripts using Github actions and AWS S3

## Environment Setup

To start with you need an @nrwl/nx workspaceÂ 

`npx create-nx-workspace@latest`

Choose an empty workspace for flexibility to set up full-stack angular & react apps depending on your future requirements.

Since we have the workspace ready, we can move forward to install the angular plugin

`cd micro-frontends`
`npm i @nrwl/angular --save-dev`

After the above steps, your package.json should be similar to the above.

## Creating host & remote applications

**Add Host Application**

The host is our base application that can help you load the remotes on-demand with routing. Let's create one.

`nx g @nrwl/angular:host host`
